    <h4>ACADEMIC REGULATIONS:   </h4>
    <p class="drop_cap">
        The conduct of examination is one of the most engaging assignments of the Department.  At the end of each semester, there should be a full examination in each course.
    </p>
    <p>The examination questions cover across all areas of the courses as contained in the course outline or syllabus.  This is done to maintain the standard of learning of the Department.  About four weeks to the end of every semester, staff set and submit the examination questions of the various courses offered by them.  Each staff set papers comprising of questions, model answer and marking scheme, which are sent out to the external examiner for moderation.  The moderation remarks are discussed and implemented in a Departmental meeting after which they are typed, parcelled and locked up in the faculty examination office. </p>
<p> After the examination, which comprises of 30% continuous assessment and 70% examination, the results are discussed in a Departmental meeting of examiners, compiled and presented to the Faculty Board of Examiners.  They are ultimately sent by Board to Senate directly, or through the Postgraduate School, if it is a higher degree.  The external examiner visits once in a session when he scrutinizes marked scripts, grading, performances, final year projects and interviews graduating students culminating in a report to the Vice Chancellor.  </p>
<p>Subsequently, after Senate approval, results are released to students on notice Boards of various Departments of the Faculty and at large the University.</p>
