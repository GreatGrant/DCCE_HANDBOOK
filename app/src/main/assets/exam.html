    <h4> STANDARD OF TESTS AND EXAMINATIONS: </h4>	

<p class="drop_cap">
    continuous assessment and final examination are normally given for every course at the end of each Semester.  The continuous assessment which comes in the form of quiz, tutorial or home and class work, written test, is normally graded as 30% of the total score.  The examination takes 70% making a total of 100%.  However, some courses, such as laboratory and workshop practice are non-examinable.  In such courses, the students use to attend and perform laboratory practical at least once in a week and write a comprehensive report on the experiment they perform.  At the end of the semester, the reports are assessed and graded accordingly.
</p>

    <h4>EXTERNAL EXAMINATION SYSTEM:</h4>

    <p>The Department of Computer and Communications Engineering has not yet started takings its Departmental courses for moderation. Thus, External Examinerâ€™s comment is also not available yet.</p>

    <h4> INTERVIEW WITH STUDENTS:</h4>

    <p>Currently, the Department of Computer and Communications, has five sets of undergraduates 197, 113, 110, 56 and 52 respectively, which makes a total of 528 undergraduate students.  The students will be made available to the accreditation team, as at when required, to be interviewed on their understanding, proficiency and curriculum coverage. Also, their awareness of academic regulations and cordiality or otherwise with their lecturers and other staff. </p>

    <h4>PRACTICAL/PROJECT WORK: </h4>

    <p>The Students of Department of Computer and Communications Engineering are exposed to workshops and laboratories right from their 100 Level. With regards to projects, students carry out a mini project at 400 Level and a Final Year project at 500 Level.</p>

    <h4> ENGINEERING DRAWING PRACTICE: </h4>

    <p>The 200 level students offer Engineering Drawing in both 1st and 2nd Semesters as ME 212 and ME 223 respectively.  These are courses taken from the Department of Mechanical/Production Engineering and are mandatory for all engineering students in 200 Level.  The students receive lecture at least once every week.  At the end of the lecture, assignments are given to them which they draw and defend before the next lecture.</p>

    <p>The Faculty of Engineering drawing room is well equipped with drawing tables and chairs for the students while doing their drawing assignment and also when defending the assignment(s).  At the end of the semester, all the assignments given are used as their continuous assessment, which takes 50% while examination takes 50%.</p>
