<h4>HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT:</h4>
<p class="drop_cap">
      The Department of Computer and Communications Engineering was approved in 2011 to offer courses in Computer and Communications Engineering in the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi.
    The Department recorded its first intake of undergraduates in the 2011/2012 academic session.
    It currently has five sets of undergraduates at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 levels numbered 197, 113, 110, 56 and 52 respectively, which makes a total of 528 undergraduate students.
    More than 90% of the students admitted into the Department of Computer and Communications Engineering undergo a one-year pre-degree programme in Faculty of science of this university.
    A few of them though come in by direct entry into 200 Level of the Department.

<p>
    Prof. O.U. Okereke, a Professor of Communication Engineering and some other prominent Lecturers of the University were some of the key staff who helped to start the Department. The syllabus to be used from 100 Level to 500 Level by the Department for the undergraduate studies was developed based on the recommendation of the National Universities Commission (NUC).

     As Computer and Communications Engineering was formed from parts of Computer, Communications, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, the courses offered from 100 to 400 Levels are courses much related to Computer and Communications Engineering.
