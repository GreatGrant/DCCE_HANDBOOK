The Department of Computer and Communications Engineering was approved in 2011 to offer 
courses in Computer and Communications Engineering in the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa 
University, Bauchi.
</p>

<p>
The Department recorded its first intake of undergraduates in the 2011/2012 
academic session. It currently has five sets of undergraduates at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 
Levels numbered--, 35, 50, 38 and 09 respectively, which makes a total of -- undergraduates 
students.
</p>

<p>
More than 90% of the students admitted into the Department of Computer and 
Communications Engineering undergo a one year pre-degree programme in Faculty of science of 
this university. A few of them though come in by direct entry into 200Level of the Department.
Prof. O.U. Okereke, a Professor of Communication Engineering and some other prominent 
Lecturers of the University were some of the key staff who helped to start the Department. 

<p>
The syllabus to be used from 100 Level to 500 Level by the Department for the undergraduate studies 
was developed based on the recommendation of the National Universities Commission (NUC).
As Computer and Communications Engineering was formed from parts of Computer, 
Communications, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, the courses offered from 100 to 400 
Levels are courses much related to Computer and Communication Engineering
